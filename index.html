<h2>About Ketuv</h2>
<p>
Ketuv was born out of a passion to see Scripture the way it was written,
in its original language, and to help others do the same. After reading the Bible
and diving into Koine Greek, I realized how much depth can be lost in translation.
Ketuv aims to bridge that gap by offering parallel text, audio, and tools for
learning while you study.
</p>
<p>
The app will offer:
<ul>
  <li>Parallel English & Greek verses</li>
  <li>Verse‑by‑verse audio</li>
  <li>Greek vocabulary and morphology lookup</li>
  <li>Cross references and commentary</li>
  <li>Study tools for learners of Greek</li>
</ul>
</p>

  <h2>Why Learn Greek Through Scripture?</h2>
  <p>
    While translations faithfully communicate the meaning of Scripture,
    nuances in the original Greek can bring fresh insight into word choices,
    grammar, and emphasis that shape how we understand God’s Word.
  </p>
  <p>
    By studying the Greek alongside the English, you’ll gain:
  <ul>
    <li>Deeper insight into theological terms</li>
    <li>Stronger understanding of the New Testament writers</li>
    <li>Tools for personal growth and ministry</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
